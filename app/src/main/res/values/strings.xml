    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Scott.
    \n\nI love exercise.
    \n\nThe kind that is periodic, methodical, and results in explosive power.
    \nFun fact is I still train at the age of 34 this day.
    \n\nI like testing myself in a battery of track tests with a fully automatic timing system.
    \nAnd sometimes I go to track meets.
    \nAnd even less sometimes, I go to the track because Manila is scarce of public facilities.
    \n\nI attained a Junior Olympic Gold medal and have earned a Division 1 scholarship in my past.
    \nI would be happy to teach you to maximize human performance.\n\n</string>
